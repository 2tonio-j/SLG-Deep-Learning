# Kannada-MNIST Starter Code

This file contains what you need to get started with the [Kannada-MNIST kaggle competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/Kannada-MNIST). The competition is a variant of the traditional MNIST dataset, where instead of trying to recognize Arabic numerals we focus on Kannada digits.

### Let's Begin!
The first thing that we want to is to make sure we have Keras and Tensorflow installed. If you have already done this feel free to skip ahead.

```{r}
install.packages("keras")
library(keras)
install_keras()             #only run this if you haven't before
```
